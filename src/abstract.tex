Replication of state is the fundamental approach to achieve scalability and availability. In order to maintain or restore replica consistency under updates, some form of synchronization is needed.
\textit{Conflict-free Replicated Data Types} (CRDTs) ensure eventual
consistency, such that replicas converge to a common state, equivalent to a
correct sequential execution without foreground synchronization.

A particular CRDT is the \textit{set} data type, which is a pervasive
abstraction for storing collections of unique elements and constitutes an
important building block for other, more complex data structures. Since the
original specification is not scalable, we improve it by introducing an
efficient algorithm for sending deltas of updates between replicas and by
partitioning a set replica into disjunctive subsets. We further add support for
limited-lifetime elements, which, in turn, enable simple garbage collection strategies to address the problem of unbounded database growth. Lastly, implementation details and
evaluation results of a client library for this data structure are presented.
