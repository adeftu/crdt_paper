Data replication is the fundamental approach to achieve load balancing,
scalability, and fault tolerance. In order to maintain replicas of some mutable
shared object consistent, synchronization is usually needed.
\textit{Conflict-free Replicated Data Types} (CRDTs) ensure eventual
consistency, such that replicas converge to a common state, equivalent to a
correct sequential execution without foreground synchronization.

A particular CRDT is the \textit{set} data type, which is a pervasive
abstraction for storing collections of unique elements and constitutes an
important building block for other more complex data structures. Since the
original specification is not scalable, we improve it by introducing an
efficient algorithm for sending deltas of updates between replicas and by
partitioning a set replica into disjunctive subsets. We further add support for
limited-lifetime elements and solve the problem of unbounded database growth
through a garbage collection mechanism. Lastly, implementation details and
evaluation results of a proof-of-concept client library for this data structure
are presented.
