Data replication is the fundamental approach to achieve load balancing,
scalability, and fault tolerance. In order to maintain replicas of some mutable
shared object consistent, synchronization is usually needed.
\textit{Conflict-free Replicated Data Types} (CRDTs) ensure eventual
consistency, such that replicas converge to a common state, equivalent to a
correct sequential execution without foreground synchronization.

A particular CRDT is the \textit{set} data type, for storing a collection of unique
elements. We improve this type specification by introducing an efficient
algorithm for sending deltas of updates between replicas and by partitioning a
set replica into disjunctive subsets. We add support for limited-lifetime
elements and solve the problem of unbounded database growth through a garbage
collection mechanism.
