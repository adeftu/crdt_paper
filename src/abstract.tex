Data replication is the fundamental approach to achieve load balancing,
scalability, and fault tolerance. In order to maintain replicas of some mutable
shared object consistent, synchronization is usually needed.
\textit{Conflict-free Replicated Data Types} (CRDTs) ensure eventual
consistency, such that replicas converge to a common state, equivalent to a
correct sequential execution without foreground synchronization.

A particular CRDT is the \textit{set} data type, a collection of unique
elements. We present an efficient algorithm for sending deltas of updates
between replicas and a specification for partitioning a set replica into
disjunctive subsets. We add support for limited-lifetime elements and solve the
problem unbounded database growth through a garbage collection mechanism.
